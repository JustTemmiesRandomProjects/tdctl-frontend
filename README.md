# TDCTL-Frontend

## 🆕 Getting started 
1. Clone the project
2. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with `npm install -g yarn`
3. Install the required packages with using ```yarn install``` 
4. Run the project locally with `yarn start`

## 🏝 Alternative backends
Working remote or without internet access? Or perhaps you're doing some backend work and want to see how the changes affect the frontend?

You can use a local backend instead of the default remote hosted backend you can start the project with:
```
yarn start:local
```
this will use a different set of enivronment variables for defining the backend URL. You can see these over in the `./environments` folder.
